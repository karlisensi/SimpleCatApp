# SimpleCatApp
a basic app I created when first learning swift to get the fundamentals down (actions, triggers, buttons, etc.)

this application was created while  I was 'tinkering' with Swift with a video aid help.
It features a button that is pressed that displays a label and a sound. It displays the "MEOW!!" For two seconds.
After two seconds, it dissappears. Press the cat again, it meows and creates the label again.
